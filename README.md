# Mementos-Tower-Defense
The repository for the development of Mementos Tower Defense, also the capstone project for Dillon Zelt, Ashton Willard, and Marcus Bair. All assets and such will be stored here when completed and have a README attached to help developers understand what has been done and what needs finished. 

Memeto's Tower Defense will be much like other Tower Defense Games where you'll pick a map to defend from waves of enemies that increase in number for an unlimited period of time. Enemies will be set on a fixed path and have distinct elemental abilities and difference defensive values for how hard it will be for them to die to certain things, including multiple phases. To combat this the towers will be allowed upgrade trees to strengthen themselves and will be able to deal various damage types to enemies (Different Towers will do differing elemental damage to be able to handle the various enemy types), each time a tower eliminates an enemy, the players will be awarded points that'll add up and determine your final score or tally at the end when players finally do fail to make it to the next round.
